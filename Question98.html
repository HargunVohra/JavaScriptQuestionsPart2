<!-- Q98) Write a JavaScript program to filter an array of objects based on a condition while also filtering out unspecified keys.
Use Array.prototype.filter() to filter the array based on the predicate fn so that it returns the objects for which the condition returned a truthy value.
On the filtered array, use Array.prototype.map() to return the new object.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() to filter out the keys which were not supplied as the keys argument. -->
