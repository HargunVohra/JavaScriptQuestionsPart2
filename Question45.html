<!-- Q45) rite a JavaScript program to split values into two groups. If an element in the filter is true, the corresponding element in the collection belongs to the first group; otherwise, it belongs to the second group.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.push() to add elements to groups, based on filter.
If filter has a truthy value for any element, add it to the first group, otherwise add it to the second group. -->
